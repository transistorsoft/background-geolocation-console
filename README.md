# Background Geolocation Console

> A simple Node server & web app with SQLite database for field-testing & analysis of the [Background Geolocation plugin](https://github.com/transistorsoft/cordova-background-geolocation-lt).

## Install

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

```bash
npm run server
```

A browser window will automatically launch the front-end web app.

## Configure The Sample App

The Background Geolocation [Sample App](https://github.com/transistorsoft/cordova-background-geolocation-SampleApp) is perfect for use with this web-application.  To configure the app, simply edit `Settings->url` and set it to `http://<your.ip.ad.dress>:9000/locations`.

You should also configure `Settings->autoSync` to `false` while out field-testing as well, so that the app doesn't try syncing each recorded location to the server running on your `localhost`.  Once you return after a test and you're back on your office Wifi, click the **[Sync]** button on the `Settings` screen to upload the cached locations to the **Background Geolocation Console** server.

## Running on Heroku

You can deploy easily the app on Heroku by pushing the code to your heroku git repository.  

Before this, you will need to create 2 environment variables (either in the heroku dashboard, or by executing `heroku config:set <VARIABLE_NAME>=<VARIABLE_VALUE>`) :  

- `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = false` : It will tell heroku to install `devDependencies` (and not only `dependencies`), required to build browserify's `bundle.min.js` file
- `GMAP_API_KEY = <PUT YOUR KEY HERE>` : A Google Maps API v3 allowed for your heroku domain (see <https://console.developers.google.com>)
- Optionally, `DB_CONNECTION_URL = postgres://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<dbname>` if you want to persist locations
  into a postgresql db (instead of a sqlite db which will be deleted after every heroku shutdown)

And to reference `heroku/nodejs` buildpack (either in the heroku dashboard, or by executing `heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs`)
